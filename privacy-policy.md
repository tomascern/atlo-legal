  ## Overview
  AviatorAtlas is an offline aviation map application for pilots.
  We are committed to protecting your privacy.

  ## Data We Collect

  ### Location Data
  AviatorAtlas requests access to your device location solely to
  display your current position (ownship) on the map. Location data
  is processed entirely on-device and is never transmitted to our
  servers or any third party.

  ### Analytics
  We use Firebase Analytics (provided by Google) to collect anonymous
  usage data such as app launches and feature usage. This data does
  not identify you personally and is used only to improve the app.
  For more information, see [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

  ### Purchases
  In-app purchases are handled entirely by Apple via StoreKit. We do
  not collect or store any payment information. Purchase records are
  managed by your Apple ID.

  ## Data We Do NOT Collect
  - No account or registration is required
  - No personal information is collected or stored
  - Map data is bundled within the app — no external tile requests are made
  - Location data never leaves your device

  ## Third-Party Services
  - **Firebase Analytics** (Google) — anonymous usage analytics
  - **Apple StoreKit** — in-app purchase processing
  - **MapLibre** — open-source map rendering (runs fully on-device)

  ## Children's Privacy
  AviatorAtlas does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

  ## Changes to This Policy
  We may update this policy occasionally. The latest version will
  always be available at this page.
